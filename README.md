Code for analysis for:

*Deep dynamical modelling of developmental trajectories with temporal transcriptomics*
Rory J. Maizels, Daniel M. Snell, James Briscoe

Input data not available here due to size: adata files created in notebooks A0.0 and A0.1 are available in GEO (GSE236520) and will soon be available to download directly with the velvet package (https://github.com/rorymaizels/velvet). Alternatively, raw fastqs can be downloaded and processed using dynast (https://github.com/rorymaizels/sciFATE2_processing) to give the input data to notebooks A0.0 and A0.1.

The full, processed, cell-typed data used for analysis can be downloaded here:
